 # SQL-Order-Inventory-Control-System
Out of all university projects, to me this has been the most engaging and demanding one.At the same time, it was a really fun way to start exploring DBMS and learning how to code in Python. 
The project asked us to create an efficient database system tailored for retail business applications, such as inventory tracking, customer order management, and supplier delivery tracking. A database was designed through an ERD and then created on SQL Server. The database includes information about customers, suppliers, products, orders, and payments. After it was filled with sample data, we were asked to write SQL queries that would fetch specific and special information out of the database. The final stage of the project had us create a connection between the SQL Server and a programming language (in my case Python was used). This integration facilitated user access to the database, enabling data retrieval and the execution of stored procedures for seamless interaction with the system

Feedback is very welcome so that I can grow and pursuit a career in Data Analysis. Do communicate with me via email to share any thoughts.
